# Prostate cancer microsimulation

This application simulates prostate cancer onset and progresion. In the microsimulation each individual of a population of a given size starts out as healthy. This state is followed by either illness (localised cancer) or death by other causes. A localised cancer can turn into either locally advanced or DX localised cancer unless preceded by death.
